# Diesel-Electric Submarine FAQ

Welcome!

This FAQ is dedicated to diesel-electric submarines. It was originally authored by Dwight Naset, who compiled more than 160 pages of material over many years of research.

We extend special thanks to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association, which has cared for the USS Pampanito since May 20, 1976. For nearly half a century, they have preserved and maintained this remarkable submarine, ensuring that future generations can experience and learn from an important piece of our naval history.

This FAQ is a true community effort. We are grateful to everyone who has contributed expertise, edits, and reviews to make this resource possible.
