# Life Aboard WW2 U.S. Subs

Life aboard a World War II U.S. submarine was demanding, highly structured, and unlike any other branch of naval service. Crews followed a strict rhythm of four hours on watch and eight hours off, though “off” rarely meant rest—there were constant drills, maintenance tasks, and duties to perform. Submarines carried about 70 to 80 men in a space little more than 300 feet long, packed with engines, torpedoes, batteries, and supplies. The constant thrum of machinery, combined with the knowledge that enemy destroyers might be listening overhead, created an environment of both tension and discipline. Surprisingly, psychologists who later studied submarine service found that the confinement and pressure did not generally magnify personal weaknesses; instead, the shared mission and the demanding routine tended to strengthen morale and camaraderie.

Privacy, in the modern sense, did not exist. Crewmen slept in bunks stacked three high, often “hot-bunking,” where the same mattress was used by different sailors on rotating shifts. Lockers were few and small, so personal belongings were limited to what could fit in a shoebox-sized space. Even meals were communal, with every man eating elbow to elbow in the tiny mess compartment. Showers were rare and strictly rationed because fresh water was needed for the batteries and the galley. In such conditions, sailors learned to respect unspoken boundaries and to tolerate quirks and habits that might otherwise cause friction. This culture of enforced intimacy forged bonds of trust that were vital when the boat went to battle stations or endured depth-charge attacks.

The challenges of submarine life extended beyond physical discomfort. Psychological endurance was critical: men had to remain calm during silent running, when every sound was minimized to avoid detection, or when the hull creaked under deep dives close to the submarine’s limits. Adaptability and technical skill were equally important, as any malfunction—from engines to torpedoes—could threaten survival. Yet many submariners later recalled their service with pride, describing it as the most intense and rewarding period of their lives. The lack of privacy, the dangers, and the long patrols were the price of belonging to one of the most elite and close-knit communities of the U.S. Navy during the war.
