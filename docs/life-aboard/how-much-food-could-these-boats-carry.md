# How much food could these boats carry

**Short answer:**  
Submarines would usually carry enough food for their patrols.  During WW2, these patrols could run two and a half months.

**Detailed answer:**  
The boats were designed for patrols of about 75 days.  Therefore, you would carry at least as much food as the planned patrol would last.
