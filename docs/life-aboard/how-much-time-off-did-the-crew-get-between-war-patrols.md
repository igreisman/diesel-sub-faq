# How much time off did the crew get between war patrols

**Short answer:**  
After a patrol, the crew was in port for four weeks.

**Detailed answer:**  
Generally speaking, the crew was in port for about four weeks after completing a full patrol.  For the first two weeks, the crew had no responsibilities for the boat and were on liberty the whole time.  A relief crew was responsible for the boat.  (See below.)  After that, the crew returned to duty for specialized training, finishing any work on repairs or upgrades on the boat, loading supplies and cleaning.  Then they would spend about a week training as a crew.

It was important to train as a full crew because there would be many new faces on board for the next patrol.  Many of these newcomers were new to submarines and a few would be experienced hands returning to submarine duty.  About 15 to 20% of the crew would be replaced at the end of each patrol.  This was done to give some of the men a break after a series of war patrols.
